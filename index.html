        <p>Lagos, my home is  located in southwestern Nigeria, it is the country's largest city and a major economic hub. Known for its vibrant culture, bustling markets, and fast-paced lifestyle, Lagos is home to over 20 million residents, making it one of the most populous cities in Africa. Tourists from the US call it the New York City of Nigeria. The city is divided into the mainland and the islands, with iconic areas like Victoria Island, and Lekki serving as centers for business, entertainment, and luxury living. Lagos boasts a rich history, diverse ethnic groups, and attractions such as the National Museum, Nike Art Gallery, and the beautiful beaches of Tarkwa Bay. Despite challenges like traffic congestion, Lagos remains a city of innovation, opportunity, and resilience.
